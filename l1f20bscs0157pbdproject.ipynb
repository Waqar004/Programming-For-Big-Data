One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[6] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6]\\n',\n",

Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[7][8] The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[9] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[10]\\n\",\n",

The NiÃ©pces' PyrÃ©olophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[30] Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[1]\\n\",\n",

The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[1][4][5] Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[6] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[7][8] The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[9] such as Project Drawdown\\'s 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[10]\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'There are costs and benefits to car use.

He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany.

By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other\\'s early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Carl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz & Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the First World War, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened, and in 1924, they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35 hp, along with the Benz name.

The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts.[39] This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world\\'s first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'As a result, Ford\\\\\\'s cars came off the line in fifteen-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5 man-hours to 1 hour 33 minutes).[40] It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford\\\\\\'s apocryphal remark, \"any color as long as it\\\\\\'s black\".[40] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months\\\\\\' pay.[40]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ford\\\\\\'s complex safety proceduresâ\\\\x80\\\\x94especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam aboutâ\\\\x80\\\\x94dramatically reduced the rate of injury.[41] The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"Fordism,\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, CitroÃ«n was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.[40]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world\\'s attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910â\\\\x80\\\\x931911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.[40]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"In Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford\\'s practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. CitroÃ«n did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault\\'s 10CV and Peugeot\\'s 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete.[40] Germany\\'s first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at RÃ¼sselsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market.[40]\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"In Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda\\'s decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Fuel and propulsion technologies\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'2011 Nissan Leaf electric car\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Low battery and motors can improve safety[42]\\\\n\\', \\'See also: Alternative fuel vehicle\\\\n\\', \\'The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and climate change.[43]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Most cars in use in the early 2020s run on gasoline burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulfur gasoline, gasoline-fueled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution.[44][45] Some cities ban older gasoline-fueled cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forward to limit climate change. Production of gasoline fueled cars peaked in 2017.[46][47]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel, Autogas and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies,[48][49] concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Out of all cars sold in 2020, 4.6% were plug-in electric, and by the end of that year there were more than 10 million plug-in electric cars on the world\\'s roads.[50] Despite rapid growth, only about 1% of cars on the world\\'s roads were fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars by the end of 2020.[50] Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1985â\\\\x80\\\\x932003 oil glut even fueled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries.

Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example, the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \"Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW\\'s iDrive and Ford\\'s MyFord Touch.

Many governments are using fiscal policies, such as road tax, to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars;[77] and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones.[78] Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive.[78]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16 years, or about 2 million kilometres (1.2 million miles) if driven a lot.[79] According to the International Energy Agency fuel economy improved 0.7% in 2017, but an annual improvement of 3.7% is needed to meet the Global Fuel Economy Initiative 2030 target.[80] The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy.[46] Many cities in Europe, have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030.[81] Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars,[82] and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050.[83]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption.[84] Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of gasoline.[85] The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.[86]\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Animals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car the \"loss of habitat potential\" may be over 50,000 m2 (540,000 sq ft) based on primary production correlations.[87] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill.
